The Geolocation-Based Attendance System is designed to streamline the process of taking attendance in a classroom setting. It features two main user roles: Faculty/Administrator and Student. Here's how the system works:

User Management:

Faculty/Administrator: This user role is responsible for managing the system. Faculty members add students to the system by entering their details. Upon successful addition,
the system automatically generates login credentials for the student and sends them via email.

Student:

Students do not register themselves. Instead, they receive their login credentials from the system-generated email. They use these credentials to log in to their accounts.

Class Management:

Faculty members add classes to the system, providing details such as class name, location, timings, and duration. When adding a class, the system generates a unique QR code for that specific class session.

Attendance Marking:

Before each class session, faculty members make the QR code available to students through the system interface.
During the class session, students log in to their accounts and access the "Mark Attendance" feature. They download the QR code associated with the ongoing class from their dashboard.
Students then upload the QR code within the specified time frame.

Geolocation Verification:

Upon QR code submission, the system verifies the current location of the student using their device's GPS.
It compares this location with the predefined location of the class.
If the student's location falls within the designated class area and the submission occurs within the class duration, attendance is marked as present; otherwise, it's marked as absent.
Attendance Records:

The system maintains a record of attendance for each class session, indicating whether each student was present or absent.
By automating the attendance tracking process and leveraging geolocation technology for verification, the Geolocation-Based Attendance System provides a reliable and efficient solution for both faculty and students.
